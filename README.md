# Hamilton
I caught the Hamilton wave when it was released on Disney+ during the summer of 2020

I had just finished my first semester of Java and I wanted to see if I could use what I knew to create a program that would print a table that shows how many times each word appears throughout the musical. It's not 100% clean, but I was proud of what I made with the knowledge I had. 

Currently I'm working a new program that uses a FileReader class to read a .txt file of the lyrics so it doesn't take up so much room in my code.
